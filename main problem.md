Hurr durr you can Quote the message and have a big URL and the entire message quoted... plus you only have to click the three dots, then copy link, then paste the link and then boom!1!

Or you can START A THREAD, how's that for a reply?/?

Or as Gemini says... > Just Reply in the moment!!1

Who tf manages this horrid platform?

Here's an idea... you completely replace the Forward arrow button on top of hovered messages with a Reply feature... which does exactly what every single other messaging platform does and quotes subtily the message you're replying to (and hyperlinks to original message).

That's it.

I don't understand these people.

Actually I do... Its rampant everywhere. People get married to an ideology in their head. They are more "team slack" than logical and therefore all things that make slack different are good.

Its cultish thinking mixed with stupidity.

If you really want to flood your channel with replies there are easier ways than what you're describing:

use the forward button and just type the channel you're in, then hit send. Same number of clicks that you're describing, maybe three extra keystrokes.

replying a thread and check the little box that says "also send to channel". One extra click plus you aren't undermining the entire notification system of slack.

One problem with the feature that you want/are describing is that you are optimizing for everyone in channel seeing your message while at the same time eliminating the ability for people who actually care about the conversation to subscribe to it and have it elevated above the other noise.

Who cares if it's flooded?
Every message simply has the replied message linked to it a few pixels up top...

What does it change? (Aside obviously being helpful to show what message was it a reply to)

It's already a wall of text. It's a messaging app.

Also if that's an issue for channels, just allow for it to be enabled/disabled on Channels/DMs

i totally get you, these people who are defending are dumbwitted, slack should've had a quote reply feature like discord, that makes conversation so easy to track in a thread ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦

the best alternative is to copy a comment and then put it as a quote via

content your reply

I am very surprised. I really like the reply feature on Discord. For the longest time, I thought it was the people vs. Slack debate. I am surprised to see people defend Slack for it. The user below saying the same number of clicks, just maybe three extra keystrokes, is hilarious, hahaha. I hope they introduce this basic feature soon.

nah, slack is just bullshit. Hate but have to use it. Also if you don't have slack prime you can't see a history of your chat. What's that

Everyday I want this feature. Slack is by far the worst messaging platform.
