# Privacy Policy for Slack Replies Extension

**Last updated: January 7, 2025**

## Overview

Slack Replies is a Chrome extension that adds a Reply button to Slack messages, allowing users to quote messages with automatic @mentions. This extension operates entirely locally within your browser and contains no code capable of transmitting data externally. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What This Extension Accesses
- **Local Website Content Only**: The extension only reads message text and author information that is already visible on your Slack workspace pages to create quoted replies with @mentions.

### What This Extension Does Not Do
- **No Data Collection**: This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
- **No User Tracking**: This extension does not track user behavior or usage patterns.
- **No External Communication**: This extension contains no code capable of sending data to external servers, APIs, or third-party services.
- **No Local Storage**: This extension does not store any user data locally on your device.
- **No Network Requests**: This extension makes no network requests and has no ability to transmit data outside your browser.

## How It Works

The extension operates entirely locally within your browser with no external communication:
1. Reads message content that is already displayed on your Slack page when you click the Reply button
2. Processes the text locally within your browser to create a quoted format
3. Inserts the quoted message directly into Slack's composer field
4. All processing happens locally within your browser - no data is transmitted anywhere
5. The extension contains no code for external communication, analytics, or data transmission

## Permissions

The extension requires:
- **Host Permission for Slack domains** (`*.slack.com`, `app.slack.com`): To inject the Reply button and read message content for quoting functionality.

## Data Sharing

This extension does not:
- Sell or transfer user data to third parties
- Use data for purposes unrelated to the extension's quote reply functionality
- Share data with advertisers or analytics services
