given the total dogshit state of slack right now, i am FED UP and am making a fucking chrome extension to deal with it.

the goal is to add a new "reply" button to the row of buttons in slack, which all it does is it takes the full formatted contents of the message you're replying to, and adds quote formatting to it with a new line, so you can respond easily to people in the same chat without starting a fucking thread. It should also append @<username> to the message in the beginning of the > @author <quote> to tag them. That's literally it. Holy shit. 

if you have more idiomatic and cleaner options lemmie know. 

make the extension, make sure you're using manifest v3. make it GOOD.
